How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Only little differences to check. Easy to go through them and see whether they are correct or not.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Incase a change of SW turns out not to help as assumed, one can easily go back to a previous version.
    It is possible to see changes in order to check what was done / howmuch was done.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro Git: not interesting lines / thoughts / incomplete things are not csaved 
    --> later it might be easier to find the version you look for cpompared to having a lot of files
    pro Google docs: you do not loose anything because of permanent saving

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because they logically belong together and it does not make sense to have only 
    some of the changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    From the command line: git log shows the whole log, but you need to scroll down.
    git diff IDold1 IDold2 shows the differences between these IDs. Remeber: scroll!

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You know you can always go back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
